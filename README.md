# TerminalChat
Chat Application with Python
Setup and Usage

Server:

Open your terminal.
Navigate to the directory where the server.py file is located using the cd command:

    cd /path/to/your/directory

Run the server by executing the following command:

    python3 server.py

Client:

Open a new terminal window.

Navigate to the directory where the client.py file is located:

Run the client by executing:


    python3 client.py

Chatting

    Choose a nickname when prompted by the client.

    Start sending and receiving messages with other connected clients.

Additional Security Considerations

Before you start using the chat application, it's important to be aware of certain security considerations:
Lack of Encryption

Messages sent and received in this chat application are not encrypted. As a result, they can potentially be intercepted and read by malicious parties. To enhance security and privacy, consider implementing encryption mechanisms in your application.
Denial of Service Vulnerabilities

This simple server does not have mechanisms in place to mitigate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Without proper rate limiting and request handling, the server may be vulnerable to DoS attacks, potentially causing service disruption. It's essential to implement security measures to address this vulnerability in production environments.
No Authentication or Authorization

The system does not verify the identity of clients, meaning anyone can connect to the server using any chosen nickname. Implementing user authentication and authorization mechanisms can enhance security and control over who can access and use the chat system.
Data Safety

The server does not log chat sessions by default. However, it's important to note that chat history can be viewed by anyone with access to a client's command line. If you require data safety and privacy, consider implementing secure data storage and access control mechanisms for chat history.

It's essential to keep these security considerations in mind when using this chat application and to implement additional security measures if you plan to use it in a production or security-sensitive environment.
